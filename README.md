# Recipe Chatbot (Kubernetes + Flask)

This is a simple chatbot application that suggests recipes based on ingredients provided by the user. Once a dish is selected, it returns the full recipe details.

The project is built using:
- Python (Flask API)
- SQLite for storing recipes
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes (Minikube) for deployment

It runs as a REST API inside a Docker container, managed by Kubernetes locally via Minikube.
